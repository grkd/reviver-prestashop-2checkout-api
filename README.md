### Integrate PrestaShop with 2Checkout Payment API

----------------------------------------

This module is based on _[PrestaShop payment module for 2Checkout Payment API](https://github.com/craigchristenson/prestashop-2checkout-api)_. Thanks _[@craigchristenson](https://github.com/craigchristenson)_ for your hard work.

The difference between the two is that instead of inline CC checkout form, this module uses multi-step CC checkout form which is more in line with how most of Prestashop 1.6 payment modules work

#### Checkout steps:
1. Payment method selection
2. A page with CC details input form is displayed
3. Order confirmation page is displayed.
